## What is it
A simple microservice app that can restart dynos of given Heroku application. Expected usage is this:

* set up a webhook for target application via Heroku logging plugin like Papertrail.
* This webhook should be run when the target app notices that sidekiq has stuck, and request
`https://my-heroku-dyno-restarter.herokuapp.com/api/restart_workers?key=restart-webhook-key&kind=web`
to restart it. 'kind' parameter here must match the process kind key at target app's Procfile, default is 'worker'.

This is implemented as a separate service to be alive when the target app feels bad and e.g. its Sidekiq queue stucks
for some reason.

## Target app access key
This app needs Heroku OAuth key to be able to restart target app, this is set via RESTART_API_KEY env var.
To obtain the OAuth key do this:

* set up a Heroku user account that basically has access only to target application - this env key will be visible to
everyone who has to the restarter app and you might not want to give them ability to restart other apps.
* get the OAuth key of that user via that user's "Account settings" page at Heroku
* put that key to RESTART_API_KEY env var of the restarter app

See also .env.example for other configuration keys.

## Local installation
